# Data Analysis with Altair (Python)

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis of the **Boonsong Lekagul Waterways** dataset, leveraging the **Altair** Python visualization library. The analysis focuses on understanding water quality and environmental factors through interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of this analysis are:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover initial patterns and anomalies.
- Apply feature engineering techniques to enhance data quality and prepare it for visualization.
- Develop insightful visualizations that highlight key environmental insights.

## Steps Included

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Identification of trends, correlations, and potential outliers
- Preliminary insights generation

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Creation and transformation of features for enhanced analysis
- Handling missing values and data imputation
- Scaling, normalization, or categorization of data features as needed

### 3. Visualizations & Key Insights
- Detailed visualizations using Altair to represent data effectively
- Interactive charts highlighting significant environmental patterns
- Summary of key findings and actionable insights

## How to Generate Visualizations
Visualizations are dynamically generated and thus not included by default. To view all visuals:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azizzoaib786/data-analysis-with-altair-python.git
   ```

2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   - Open `data-analysis-altair.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Execute all cells (`Run All`).

## Requirements
- Python (3.7 or higher recommended)
- Altair
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab

## Data Source
- Dataset used: **Boonsong Lekagul Waterways** dataset (provided within the repository)
